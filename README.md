# Analysis-Pollutant-Emissions

### Introduction
Emissions from transport are the main contributor to air pollution.The following notebook analyses the transport emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and particulate matter (PM10), with data provided annually starting from 1990. The indicator is an index to year 2000 (index 2000 = 100).

- Amount of particular pollutants in all countries in a given year
- Countries with highest(/lowest) amounts of various pollutantsin recent years.
- Highest record amount of a particular pollutant in air.
- Relationship between various pollutants.
- Change in amounts of various pollutants over time.
